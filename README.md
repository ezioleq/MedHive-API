# MedHive-API

MedHive API is a simple CRUD project about managing a small imaginary hospital 🏥

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

You need to carry out these steps to launch the project or start working with it.

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for your current platform
- Clone the repository

## 🔨 How to run the server

Learn how to start the server or start working with it's code.

1. Enter the cloned repository directory eg. `cd MedHive-API`
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `npm i`
3. Build the project with `npm run build`
4. Start the server with `npm start`
5. The server by default is available at https://localhost:3000

### 🏗️ Development mode

When creating a server, restarting it is a bit cumbersome. So you can start the server in development mode. From now on, any change you make will automatically restart the server with the new code, and you will see the changes immediately when you refresh the page or make another request.

You can achive that by using `npm run dev`

If you're running the server for the first time you may need to build it first with `npm run build`

## 👥 How to contribute

The flow is pretty common.

1. Create a new branch in git
    - you may need to work on your own fork of the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Test your new feature
4. Before commiting take care of the code formatting. We're providing a simple way to format your code by running `npm run format`. Some editors will automatically format your code on file save (you may need to explicitly enable this option in settings).
5. Create a pull request
6. Wait for the code review to be done
7. Merge your pull request
8. Well done!
